# Shiny App
The three main components of a Shiny App are the input, output, and the user interface (UI).
*Input* is comprised of input controls which allow a user to interact with reactive functions.
*Output* is comprised of objects that display different visualizations based on the type of input provided. These can be as simple as text or as complicated as an interactive plot.
The *UI* is comprised of a user interface *object* and the *server* that it communicates with.They work as a pair.
